        <p>Welcome to the new Play Midnight Material! First of all, please know this is still a work in progress and has a long ways to go. I wanted to take this chance to thank all of you for blowing up my email/chrome/subreddit when Google broke everything. I really appreciate all the positive feedback, and hope you guys can bear with me while I continue to polish things up.</p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>

        <p>As you know, this is still a work in progress that I threw together over the weekend. There <em>will</em> be some areas that need work. Please let me know, preferably via <a href="http://reddit.com/r/PlayMidnight">Reddit</a>, <a href="mailto:iam@christieman.com">email</a>, or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ljmjmhjkcgfmfdhgplikncgndbdeckci">Chrome Webstore</a>. Screenshots are definitely the most helpful, or even css fixes if you're into that kind of thing.</p>

        <h3>Personal Message</h3>

        <p>Again, I just wanted to personally thank every one of you for all of the feedback you've given me. I never figured this extension would blow up as much as it did, and it's because of all of you that it's come this far. I want to remind you again that I'm going to keep Play Midnight free, with no ads. If you'd like to help support this project in any way, please consider spreading the word via friends, <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, or by <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KHH9ZJH42FF4J">buying me some much needed coffee</a>. Thanks again, Chris Tieman.</p>
